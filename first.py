    # The active selection `Eq` refers to a function from the `sympy` library in Python. `sympy` is a powerful symbolic mathematics library that allows 
    #       for algebraic manipulation and solving of mathematical expressions.
    # The `Eq` function is used to create an equation object. It takes two arguments, representing the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation, 
    #       respectively. For example, `Eq(a * x**3 - b * x**2 - c * x + d, 0)` creates an equation representing `a*x^3 - b*x^2 - c*x + d = 0`.
    # This equation object can then be used with other `sympy` functions, such as `solve`, to find the values of variables that satisfy the equation. 
    #       This is particularly useful for solving algebraic equations symbolically, rather than numerically, allowing for exact solutions where possible.
    
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    # When using solve, you typically pass an equation or a system of equations as the first argument, 
    #       and the variable(s) for which you want to solve as the second argument. For example, solve(Eq(a * x**3 - b * x**2 - c * x + d, 0), x) would solve the cubic equation a*x^3 - b*x^2 - c*x + d = 0 for the variable x.
    # The function returns a list of solutions. If the equation has multiple solutions, all of them will be included in the list. 
    #       If there are no solutions, the list will be empty. This makes solve an essential function for algebraic manipulation and solving mathematical 
    #       problems symbolically in Python.
